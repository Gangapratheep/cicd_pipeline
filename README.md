The error you're seeing:

```
Error response from daemon: bridge is a pre-defined network and cannot be removed
```

means that `bridge` is one of Docker‚Äôs **default networks**, and **Docker does not allow removing default networks** like:

* `bridge`
* `host`
* `none`

These are **built-in** and are essential for Docker‚Äôs operation.

### üîç Default Docker Networks:

| Name     | Type   | Description                                     |
| -------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `bridge` | bridge | Default network for containers on a single host |
| `host`   | host   | Shares the host‚Äôs networking stack              |
| `none`   | null   | Disables networking for a container             |

You **can only remove user-defined networks**, like this one from your earlier output:

```
578e6511f261   node_project_node_mysql_net   bridge    local
```

---

### ‚úÖ So in summary:

* You **cannot delete** the `bridge`, `host`, or `none` networks.
* You **can delete** custom networks (those you create with `docker network create`) **if they‚Äôre not in use**.

Let me know if you want to list containers using a network or clean up all unused networks.


--------------------------------------------
You're almost there! Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening and what you need to do:

---

### ‚ùå Problem:

You typed:

```bash
docke volume rm all
```

* `docke` is a typo ‚Üí should be `docker`
* `all` is not a valid volume name

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Ways to Remove Docker Volumes

#### üîπ Option 1: Remove a **specific volume** by name:

```bash
docker volume rm <volume_name>
```

Example:

```bash
docker volume rm node_project_mysql_data
```

---

#### üîπ Option 2: Remove **all unused volumes** (safe cleanup):

```bash
docker volume prune
```

This removes **volumes not used by any containers**.
You‚Äôll be prompted to confirm.

---

#### üîπ Option 3: Remove **all volumes forcefully** (‚ö†Ô∏è use with caution):

```bash
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
```

This command:

* `docker volume ls -q` ‚Üí lists all volume names
* `docker volume rm ...` ‚Üí deletes them all

‚ö†Ô∏è **Danger:** This will remove **all volumes**, even if they're in use, causing **data loss** for containers using those volumes.

---

### Let me know if you want:

* To back up volume data before deletion
* To list which containers are using which volumes
* To automate cleanup in a script
